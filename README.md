# L4-load-aware-load-balancer
Designed and implemented a Layer 4 load-aware load balancer using eBPF/XDP. The balancer dynamically distributed incoming network traffic across backend servers by monitoring their current load, optimizing resource utilization and performance. Leveraged transport layer data (IP addresses and TCP/UDP ports) for informed routing decisions, achieving efficient traffic management and load distribution.
